I received my PhD in Statistics under Prof. Hans-Georg Müller at UC Davis. Broadly, I am interested in the treatment of complex-structured data whose geometries thwart traditional, off-the-shelf statistical methods. In particular I am attracted to questions concerning functional data, especially when the functions are multivariate, contaminated by warping, or subject to constraints, as in the case of densities or monotonic curves. I am also a contributor and past maintainer of the R package fdapace. Beyond developing methodology, I’m also a fan of working in applied statistics. My past collaborations span a wide variety of domains: in the past I’ve collaborated with neuroscientists from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, veterenarians from the San Diego Zoo, and the researchers behind Mt. Everest’s Himalayan Database, to name a few.

Cody Carroll received his BS in Mathematics at UT Austin and MS and PhD in Statistics at UC Davis while working with Prof. Hans-Georg Müller. His methodological research interests focus on warping problems for multivariate functional and longitudinal data, particularly in the context of human growth curves. In his applied work he has collaborated with neuroscientists from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, veterinarians from the San Diego Zoo, and the researchers behind Mt. Everest’s Himalayan Database, to name a few. He is currently working as a Data Scientist at Wells Fargo.
