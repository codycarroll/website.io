I am a PhD candidate in Statistics at UC Davis, working with [Prof. Hans-Georg MÃ¼ller](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/). Broadly, I am interested in the treatment of complex-structured data whose geometries thwart traditional, off-the-shelf statistical methods. In particular I am attracted to questions concerning functional data, especially when the functions are multivariate, contaminated by warping, or subject to constraints, as in the case of densities or monotonic curves. My graduate work aims at developing new methods for time warping problems and quantifying intercomponent time dynamics for multivariate functional data.

I am also a versatile statistical consultant and communicator. I like finding intuitive and creative ways of conveying results and breaking through the "language barrier" between statisticians and other scientists. My applied collaborations span a wide variety of domains, ranging from veterinary science to mountaineering to neuroimaging. 

I also maintain the R package [fdapace](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fdapace/index.html). Please report any bugs you find to either me or my colleague Alvaro Gajardo Cataldo.
